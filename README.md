  **.bashrc** 
- The two functions currently in the .bashrc file in the aliases/functions directory are additions to my current .bashrc config (which can be located in it's entirety here:https://github.com/HighDensityAwesome/dotfiles.git). Feel free to use them to speed up your GitHub workflow, if you have any workflow improvement functions of your own let me know.
